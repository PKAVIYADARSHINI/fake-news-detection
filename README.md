## Introduction

Fake news has become a significant issue in the age of digital media, leading to the spread of misinformation. This project aims to develop a model that can accurately classify news articles as fake or true, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains labeled news articles. Each article is categorized as either "Fake" or "True." The dataset is typically preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information before being used to train the model.

## Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have Python installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fake-news-detection
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run the Jupyter notebook to train the model or use the pre-trained model to classify new articles.

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells to train the model and test it on new data.

## Model Training

The model is trained using a dataset of news articles. The notebook includes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, vectorization, and feature extraction. The model is then trained using a machine learning algorithm such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or a more complex deep learning model.

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on a test set to measure its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help determine the effectiveness of the model in classifying news articles.

## Results

The model achieves [insert accuracy]% accuracy on the test dataset, with precision, recall, and F1-scores as follows:

- Precision: [insert precision]
- Recall: [insert recall]
- F1-Score: [insert F1-score]
